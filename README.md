## 📘 Project Overview

This project investigates the effect of hormonal therapy on the survival of breast cancer patients using survival analysis techniques. Most breast cancers are hormone-receptor positive, meaning they grow in response to estrogen or progesterone. Hormonal treatments like tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors are commonly used to slow progression.

Using data from 686 patients, this analysis compares survival outcomes between those who received hormonal therapy and those who did not, adjusting for various clinical and biological covariates.
